# n3-next

This project is a prototype of n3-charts for Angular. The 2.0 release of Angular involved a major redesign from the ground up which caused complete Component incompatibility between AngularJS (1.x)  and Angular (2+).

n3 is based on the d3 charting engine:

The API specification, design, and code will follow the excellent examples laid out by the ng-bootstrap team:
